    "### Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "+ What's the project about? What problem are you solving?\n",
    "\n",
    "Project focuses on predicting: 1)likelihood that consumer disputes financial institution resolution regarding consumer complaint, 2) likelihood that complaint results in monetary restitution to consumer, and 3) what type of response a consumer will receive based on various inputs (e.g. financial institution, type of complaint, how complaint submitted, state)\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems being solved:\n",
    "     - Allow financial institutions to predict top 3 complaints by state and \"success\" rate (success rate = Little to no consumer disputes regarding resolution) of resolution\n",
    "     - Allow financial institutions to determine if resolutions to same complaint vary by state and if that, in turn, impacts resolution success\n",
    "     - Allow consumers to identify financial institutions with greatest number of complaints and highest consumer resolution rate (by state)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a logistic regression model with possible use of decision tree modeling as a precursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables (or factors) will have binary value (such as whether consumer disputed resolution). Other factors will reflect a continuous number (such as number of complaint type A over past 4 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ What kind of impact do you think it could have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using only this dataset, the impact could be significant from an investor view. For example, if Wells Fargo sees a spike in complaints, investors may lower the investment grade (e.g. from B to D).\n",
    "\n",
    "What would be more helpful would be to combine findings from this dataset with economic data by state and zip code. During the recession and housing bubble, states and even certain zip codes were affected differently. Foreclosures were particularly high in certain areas and this would have an impact on mortgage rate complaints by consumers (one of the variables in my dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial institution: because varying companies handle complaints differently and some companies are more customer-focused than others\n",
    "\n",
    "States: geographic economic differences are significant with the U.S.\n"
